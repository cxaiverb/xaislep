Spotify sleep timer for linux


Im not a very good code person
This is the best I could do with my limited knowledge
I also am new to linux
Just replaced Windows as my main OS a month ago

If anyone knows how to make both minutes and hours work, please pull request!

    "Set a sleep timer for Spotify"
    
    "Syntax: xaislep [-t #|-m #]"
    "Can only do minutes or hours, not both"
    
    "options:"
    "h         Shows this."
    "t         Sets the hours."
    "m         Sets the minutes."
