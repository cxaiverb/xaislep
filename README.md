Spotify sleep timer for linux


Im not a very good code person.
This is the best I could do with my limited knowledge.
I also am new to linux, just replaced Windows as my main OS a month ago.

Theres a good chance I'll add Wondows support in the future as well in a C# console app or a GUI thing, but C# is not my strong suit. Still learning it.

If anyone knows how to make both minutes and hours work, please pull request!

(I was told today how to fix it properly, but im not big brain enough to do it rn. will be looking into and maybe updating this soonish)

    "Set a sleep timer for Spotify"
    
    "Syntax: xaislep [-t #|-m #]"
    "Can only do minutes or hours, not both"
    
    "options:"
    "h         Shows this."
    "t         Sets the hours."
    "m         Sets the minutes."
